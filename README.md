# LinearAlgebra
Linear algebra in C++ using BLAS and LAPACK libraries

## Functions

- [gesv](test/gesv.cpp) - LU decomposition to solve system of linear equations for x in `Ax=b`
- [dot](test/dot.cpp) - Computes the dot product of two 1D vectors
- [gemv](test/gemv.cpp) - Performs matrix multiplication of a matrix by a vector `y = alpha*A*x + beta*y`
- [axpy](test/axpy.cpp) - Vector product `y = a*x + y`
- [copy](test/copy.cpp) - Copy vector `x` into vector `y`
